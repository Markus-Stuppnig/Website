			"On December 13<sup>th</sup> I stepped onto a plane, headed to Chicago, United States. With only 16 years of age, I was on my way into a completely different life, meeting people from another culture and staying there for a whole semester. Now that it's all over, I can comfortably say that it was the best decision I ever made. I built so many friendships, still being close with some of them. And of course, my ability and my skills with the english language skyrocketed. I not only created lasting memories, but also improved as a person. I am sooo thankful for the time I spent there and all the opportunities that came up for me. Experiencing american culture was truly fascinating.<br /><br />Thank you Ben, Fred, Skyler, Marifer, Jefferson, Ashton, Derek, Christian, and all of you. You made my time in the USA great!<br /><br /><a href='/journeys/exchange' class='underline decoration-[0.2rem] underline-offset-4'>See more!</a>",

			"Receiving my PADI Open Water Diver Certification in summer 2023, I can now offially call myself being part of the wonderful diving community. You will never forget your first breath under the water, it's such a fascinating thing to experience. Being in exposure to the aquatic world and seing all this life is not only appealing, but it also relaxes you on a completely different level. Another awesome thing is diving with a close friend or in a group. Just the thought of being in such a dangerous place, somewhere humans wouldn't survive without modern technology and having to support each other is an incredible feeling.<br /><br /><a href='/contact' class='underline decoration-[0.2rem] underline-offset-4'>Let's go dive together!</a>",
